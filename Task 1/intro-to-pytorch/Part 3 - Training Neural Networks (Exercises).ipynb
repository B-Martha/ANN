Neural networks with non-linear activations work like universal function approximators. There is some function that maps your input to the output.

To get to the minimum in the least amount of time, we then want to follow the gradient (downwards).

The general process with PyTorch:\n","\n","* Make a forward pass through the network \n","* Use the network output to calculate the loss\n","* Perform a backward pass through the network with `loss.backward()` to calculate the gradients\n","* Take a step with the optimizer to update the weights\n","\n","Below I'll go through one training step and print out the weights and gradients so you can see how it changes. Note that I have a line of code `optimizer.zero_grad()`. When you do multiple backwards passes with the same parameters, the gradients are accumulated. This means that you need to zero the gradients on each training pass or you'll retain gradients from previous training batches."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"5CUpY0AsI1oT","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":286},"outputId":"807a76e9-2ef4-4c76-b216-c0cf299bc583","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1589006488753,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":3961,"user":{"displayName":"Bisweswar Martha","photoUrl":"","userId":"13304568005249846330"}}},"source":["print('Initial weights - ', model[0].weight)\n","\n","images, labels = next(iter(trainloader))\n","images.resize_(64, 784)\n","\n","# Clear the gradients, do this because gradients are accumulated\n","optimizer.zero_grad()\n","\n","# Forward pass, then backward pass, then update weights\n","output = model(images)\n","loss = criterion(output, labels)\n","loss.backward()\n","print('Gradient -', model[0].weight.grad)"],"execution_count":14,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Initial weights -  Parameter containing:\n","tensor([[-0.0307,  0.0130,  0.0141,  ..., -0.0068, -0.0285, -0.0250],\n","        [-0.0049, -0.0176,  0.0127,  ..., -0.0233, -0.0262, -0.0305],\n","        [-0.0059,  0.0176, -0.0086,  ...,  0.0016, -0.0099,  0.0099],\n","        ...,\n","        [-0.0189,  0.0211, -0.0049,  ..., -0.0324,  0.0130, -0.0084],\n","        [-0.0132,  0.0251, -0.0168,  ...,  0.0192, -0.0162,  0.0298],\n","        [-0.0291, -0.0140, -0.0290,  ...,  0.0207, -0.0084,  0.0173]],\n","       requires_grad=True)\n","Gradient - tensor([[ 0.0000,  0.0000,  0.0000,  ...,  0.0000,  0.0000,  0.0000],\n","        [-0.0021, -0.0021, -0.0021,  ..., -0.0021, -0.0021, -0.0021],\n","        [ 0.0003,  0.0003,  0.0003,  ...,  0.0003,  0.0003,  0.0003],\n","        ...,\n","        [ 0.0049,  0.0049,  0.0049,  ...,  0.0049,  0.0049,  0.0049],\n","        [-0.0004, -0.0004, -0.0004,  ..., -0.0004, -0.0004, -0.0004],\n","        [-0.0008, -0.0008, -0.0008,  ..., -0.0008, -0.0008, -0.0008]])\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"IVvLjibFI1oY","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":168},"outputId":"5a30c4cc-8bc6-4057-bce1-d57b49130be7","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1589006488755,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":3954,"user":{"displayName":"Bisweswar Martha","photoUrl":"","userId":"13304568005249846330"}}},"source":["# Take an update step and few the new weights\n","optimizer.step()\n","print('Updated weights - ', model[0].weight)"],"execution_count":15,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Updated weights -  Parameter containing:\n","tensor([[-0.0307,  0.0130,  0.0141,  ..., -0.0068, -0.0285, -0.0250],\n","        [-0.0049, -0.0176,  0.0127,  ..., -0.0233, -0.0262, -0.0305],\n","        [-0.0059,  0.0176, -0.0086,  ...,  0.0016, -0.0099,  0.0098],\n","        ...,\n","        [-0.0189,  0.0211, -0.0049,  ..., -0.0325,  0.0129, -0.0084],\n","        [-0.0132,  0.0251, -0.0168,  ...,  0.0192, -0.0162,  0.0298],\n","        [-0.0291, -0.0140, -0.0290,  ...,  0.0208, -0.0084,  0.0173]],\n","       requires_grad=True)\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"qpUfTf6wI1oc","colab_type":"text"},"source":["### Training for real\n","\n","Now we'll put this algorithm into a loop so we can go through all the images.
